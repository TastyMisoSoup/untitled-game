In the Game Setup Screen the player will setup multiple parameters on how the game will play

Match Duration - The length of the match will be by default 10 minutes but the Host has the ability to change the duration from a set of preset time limits (2.5 minutes, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes, 60 minutes etc.). On Match End, players will be prompted with a Score Screen in which they can see how they have performed. (To see how individual player's score is evaluated read the [[Score System]] note) 

Player Maximum - the game Host will choose how many players will be in any given match. The limit will be tested when we will get to creating server systems. In case of Single-Player, this option will be omitted.

Bot Count - how many bots will be added to the game. The maximum amount of bots will also be tested. In Multi-player the maximum amount will be limited by the Player Maximum

Map Selection - the Host chooses from a series of maps that will vary in size (depending on the Player Maximum some maps will be locked out if the Maps will be too small to fit that many players)

Server Listing - in case of Multi-player, the Host will select if the game will be Public and be visible in the Server Listing online or if the game will be set as Private and only be accessible via a direct IP address.

Server Password - in case of Multi-player, the Host will be allowed to setup a Server Password.

After the player joins a game, they will start play as their [[Mech]] (if they didn't customize their Mech  in the [[Mech Bay]], they will be given the default Mech setup)

**Gameplay Loop:**
Player spawns into the arena and seeks other Mechs to destroy. Destroyed Mechs drop Scrap which can be picked up to heal your own Mech. The goal is to gain as many points from frags. (see [[Score System]] for more information). If the player dies they respawn after a couple of seconds.

**Main Mechanics/Features:** 
Every Mech will be equipped with a [[Primary Weapon]] and a [[Secondary Weapon ]] (possibly also have Modules, which will have active abilities like Dash, Barrier, Invisibility).

The Weapons will play off each other via a Heat/Energy system. To achieve maximum potential damage efficiecy the player will have to balance their Heat/Energy.
